%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% CHAPTER 1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SECTION 1.1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{Chapter 12 Section 12.1}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXERCISE 2 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection*{Ch.12, \S 12.1,  Exercise 4} There are eight different functions $ f : \{a, b, c \} \rightarrow \{0, 1 \} $. List them all. Diagrams will suffice.

\begin{proof}[Solution to Ch.1, \S 1.1,  Exercise 2] 
$$ f = \{(a, 0), (b, 0), (c, 0) \} $$
$$ f = \{(a, 0), (b, 1), (c, 0) \} $$
$$ f = \{(a, 0), (b, 0), (c, 1) \} $$
$$ f = \{(a, 0), (b, 1), (c, 1) \} $$
$$ f = \{(a, 1), (b, 0), (c, 0) \} $$
$$ f = \{(a, 1), (b, 1), (c, 0) \} $$
$$ f = \{(a, 1), (b, 0), (c, 1) \} $$
$$ f = \{(a, 1), (b, 1), (c, 1) \} $$
\end{proof}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXERCISE 8 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\subsection*{Ch.12, \S 12.1,  Exercise 6}  Suppose $ f : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} $ is defined as $ f = \{(x, 4x + 5) : x \in \mathbb{Z} \} $. State the domain, codomain and range of $ f $. Find $ f(10) $.

\begin{proof}[Solution to Ch.12, \S 12.1,  Exercise 6] \ \\
The domain of the function is $ \{ x : x \in \mathbb{Z} \} $. \\
The codomain of the function is $ \{ x : x \in \mathbb{Z} \} $. \\
The range of the function is $ \{ x : x = 4n , n \in \mathbb{Z} \} $. \\

\end{proof}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXERCISE 18 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\subsection*{Ch.12, \S 12.2,  Exercise 5}  A function $ f : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} $ is defined as $ f(n) = 2n + 1 $ . Verify whether this function is injective and whether it is surjective.

\begin{proof}[Solution to Ch.12, \S 12.2,  Exercise 5] \ \\
\textbf{Proposition.} The function is injective but not surjective.\\
\textbf{Step 1.} Prove the function is injective.
\textit{Proof.} Assume $ f(x) = f(y) $. We have $ 2x + 1 = 2y + 1 $, thus $ x = y $.\\
\textbf{Step 2.} Prove the function is not surjective.\\
\textit{Proof.} There exist element $ 2 $ which $ f(x) = 2x + 1 \neq 2 $ for every $ x \in \mathbb{Z} $. The function is injective but not surjective.
\end{proof}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXERCISE 30 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\subsection*{Ch.12, \S 12.2,  Exercise 10}  Prove that the function $ f: \mathbb{R} - {1} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} - {1} $ defined by $ f(x) = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{x + 1}{x - 1} \end{pmatrix}^3 $ is bijective.

\begin{proof}[Solution to Ch.12, \S 12.2,  Exercise 10] \ \\
\textbf{Proposition.} The $ f(x) $ is bijective.\\
\textbf{Step 1.} Prove $ f(x) $ is injective.\\
\textit{Proof.} Assume $ f(x) = f(y) $, we have $ \begin{pmatrix} \frac{x + 1}{x - 1} \end{pmatrix}^3 = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{y + 1}{y - 1} \end{pmatrix}^3 $, taking the cubic root on both side get $ \begin{pmatrix} \frac{x + 1}{x - 1} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{y + 1}{y - 1} \end{pmatrix} $. Therefor we have:
$$ (x + 1) * (y - 1) = (y + 1) * (x - 1) $$
$$ xy + y - x = xy + x - y $$
$$ y - x = x - y $$
$$ 2y = 2x $$
$$ x = y $$
\textbf{Step 2.} Prove $ f(x) $ is sujective. \\
\textit{Proof.} Suppose $ f(x) = c $, we have $ f(x) = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{x + 1}{x - 1} \end{pmatrix}^3 = c $. Sove for $ x $, we get $ x = \frac{1 + \sqrt[3]{c}}{1 - \sqrt[3]{c}}, x \in \mathbb{R} $. It follows that $ f(x) $ is surjective.
The $ f(x) $ is surjective and injective, so it is bijective.
\end{proof}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXERCISE 38 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\subsection*{Ch.1, \S 1.1,  Exercise 38} 



\begin{proof}[Solution to Ch.1, \S 1.1,  Exercise 38]

\end{proof}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXERCISE 40 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\subsection*{Ch.1, \S 1.1,  Exercise 40} 
 Sketch the following set of points in the $x,y$-plane:
$$
S=\{(x,y): x\in [0,1], \ y\in 1,2]\}
$$



\begin{proof}[Solution to Ch.1, \S 1.1,  Exercise 40]
\ 
For this problem I first sketched my own solution by hand.  However, to implement my solution in \LaTeX, I  modifed the tikz code from the webpage: 
\\ 
\url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/140312/tikz-shading-region-bounded-by-several-curves}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
%graph
\draw[draw=gray!50!white,fill=gray!50!white] 
    plot[smooth,samples=100,domain=0:1] (\x,{1}) -- 
    plot[smooth,samples=100,domain=1:0] (\x,{2});
\draw[domain=0:4] plot (\x,{1});
\draw[domain=0:4] plot (\x,{2});
\draw (1,0)--(1,2.5);
%coordinate grid
\draw (-.5,0)--(4.5,0) node[right]{$x$};
\draw (0,-1.5)--(0,2.5) node[above]{$y$};
\foreach \x in {1,2,3,4}
    \draw (\x,2pt)--(\x,-2pt) node[below] {$\x$};
\foreach \y/\ytext in {1,2}
    \draw (2pt,\y)--(-2pt,\y) node[left] {$\y$};    
%labels 
\node at (.5,1.5) {$S$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\end{proof}
