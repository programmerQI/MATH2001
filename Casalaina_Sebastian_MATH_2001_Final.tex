\textbf{True of False.}  Let $S$ be a set and   let $\mathscr C\subseteq \mathscr P(S)$ be a collection of subsets  of $S$ with the following property:   For any set $I$, if for each $i\in I$ we are given a set 
  $C_i\in \mathscr C$, and for all $i,j\in I$ we have $C_i\subseteq C_j$ or $C_j\subseteq C_i$, then  $\bigcup_{i\in I}C_i\in \mathscr C$.

There exists $C\in \mathscr C$ such that for all $C'\in \mathscr C$, if $C\subseteq C'$, then $C=C'$.

\question[10]
For an incidence plane $(\Pi,\Lambda)$, given a line $\ell\in \Lambda$ and a point $P\in \Pi$ such that $P\notin\ell$, consider the following properties:

\begin{quote}


\begin{enumerate}
\item[(P0)] There \emph{does not exist} $\ell'\in \Lambda$ such that $P\in \ell'$ and $\ell'\cap \ell = \emptyset$.

\item[(P1)] There \emph{exists exactly one} $\ell'\in \Lambda$ such that $P\in \ell'$ and $\ell'\cap \ell = \emptyset$.

\item[(P2)] There \emph{exists at least two}  $\ell'\in \Lambda$ such that $P\in \ell'$ and $\ell'\cap \ell = \emptyset$.

\end{enumerate}

\end{quote}


\textbf{Find an example of an incidence plane  $(\Pi,\Lambda)$ with exactly five points, such that for each of the properties above there exists a point and a line satisfying that property}.  In other words,  find a single   incidence plane $(\Pi,\Lambda)$ with $|\Pi|=5$, such that for $i=0,1,2$, there exists  $\ell_i\in \Lambda$  and $P_i\in \Pi$ with $P_i\notin \ell_i$, such that  $\ell_i$ and $P_i$ satisfy property (P$i$).

\question
A polynomial in one variable, $x$,  with rational coefficients can, by definition, be written in the form
$$
p(x)= a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\cdots + a_dx^d
$$
where $a_0,a_1,\dots,a_d\in \mathbb Q$, and $d$ is some nonnegative integer.  If in the expression above for $p(x)$ we have $a_d\ne 0$, then we say $p(x)$ has degree $d$.  

\vskip .2 cm 
We denote by $\mathbb Q[x]$ the set of all polynomials in $x$ with rational coefficients.  Denote by $\mathbb Q[x]_d\subseteq \mathbb Q[x]$ the subset consisting of those polynomials that have degree at most $d$, union  the set containing the zero polynomial (the zero polynomial does not have a degree using our definition above). 

\begin{parts}
\part[5]  Let  $d$ be a nonnegative integer.  \textbf{Show that  the set $\mathbb Q[x]_d$ is countable}.  

\vskip .2 cm 
[Hint: Show that $\mathbb Q[x]_d$ is in bijection with $\mathbb Q^{d+1}$.]
