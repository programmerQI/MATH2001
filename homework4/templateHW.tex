%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXERCISE 40 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\subsection*{Ch.1, \S 1.1,  Exercise 40} 
 Sketch the following set of points in the $x,y$-plane:
$$
S=\{(x,y): x\in [0,1], \ y\in 1,2]\}
$$



\begin{proof}[Solution to Ch.1, \S 1.1,  Exercise 40]
\ 
For this problem I first sketched my own solution by hand.  However, to implement my solution in \LaTeX, I  modifed the tikz code from the webpage: 
\\ 
\url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/140312/tikz-shading-region-bounded-by-several-curves}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
%graph
\draw[draw=gray!50!white,fill=gray!50!white] 
    plot[smooth,samples=100,domain=0:1] (\x,{1}) -- 
    plot[smooth,samples=100,domain=1:0] (\x,{2});
\draw[domain=0:4] plot (\x,{1});
\draw[domain=0:4] plot (\x,{2});
\draw (1,0)--(1,2.5);
%coordinate grid
\draw (-.5,0)--(4.5,0) node[right]{$x$};
\draw (0,-1.5)--(0,2.5) node[above]{$y$};
\foreach \x in {1,2,3,4}
    \draw (\x,2pt)--(\x,-2pt) node[below] {$\x$};
\foreach \y/\ytext in {1,2}
    \draw (2pt,\y)--(-2pt,\y) node[left] {$\y$};    
%labels 
\node at (.5,1.5) {$S$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\end{proof}
